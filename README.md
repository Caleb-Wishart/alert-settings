# Alert Settings

Alerts can be configured per user using console commands.  
Using these commands will not disable achievements but they can be hard to remember and are not user friendly.

This mod adds settings in mod settings to configure alert visibility per user, it simplifies configuration to three states:

- **Enabled**: The alert will be shown as usual and play sound.
- **Disabled**: The alert will not be shown and will not play sound.
- **Muted**: The alert will be shown but will not play sound.

Using the console commands will also continue to work and will update the settings in the mod settings accordingly.
